# 💎 I Am Rich – Flutter App

This is a simple Flutter mobile app inspired by the viral "I Am Rich" concept. It displays a centered diamond image on a styled screen (I replace this with Redeem innovations LLC Logo) — ideal for learning the basics of Flutter app structure, UI layout, and asset management.

## 🎯 Project Goal

- Understand the structure of a basic Flutter app.
- Learn how to use widgets like `MaterialApp`, `Scaffold`, `AppBar`, `Center`, and `Image`.
- Practice including and displaying custom image assets.

## 🧠 Flutter Concepts Practiced

- `main()` as the entry point of a Flutter app
- Using `runApp()` with `MaterialApp`
- Structuring UI with `Scaffold`, `AppBar`, and `Center`
- Adding and using local image assets with `AssetImage`
